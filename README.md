>## Build, Run, and, Test Code
> Our project is buildable, however, you will need to setup the database.

> The easiest way to do this is to use our tables_create.sql file. 
> 1) Create a database with an expected username and password
> 2) Update the dbHandle.js with your username, password, and database name
> 3) Inject the tables_create.sql into the database you created
> 4) Profit

> To run the website use... **npm start**
