We want Sunday to Saturday, pass in a date from JS and find that weeks worth of information. 

By Thursday have a database Query that presents a weeks worth of information regardless of the day passed in. Hopefully have it in the handle to allow its use in the front end as well. Done

By next Tuesday have in db handle a way to push workouts into the db that matches the form.
